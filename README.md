Available Scripts

npm start: Runs the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000. The app reloads on edits, and lint errors are displayed in the console.

npm test: Launches the interactive test runner.

npm run build: Builds the app for production, optimizing the build for the best performance.

npm run eject: Provides full control over the build configuration by copying configuration files and dependencies directly into your project. Note that this is irreversible.
